Day 69 Goals - Adding Users to Our Blog Project
Wouldn't it be great if we could have some users on our blog? What if we could let anyone sign up and comment on our blog posts? In order for that to work, we would need to add authentication to our blog. This will be the final step in our Blog Capstone Project. Once we're done, it will be a fully-fledged blog website that you can publish and launch.
